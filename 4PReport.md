##4P JCC Report
Why **4P?**
 
- This is as much a **P**roblem solving workshop as it is a Java workshop
     - CyberDojo/TDD (regardless of whether they will use it in their future workplace or not) will give them a _teachable_ organized approach to problem solving 
        - flowcharts, dry runs, pseudo code, etc. are the ways of the past (show me one programmer at KGISL who uses this?)
        - https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript#favor-functional-programming-over-imperative-programming - one more reason to learn Functions really well through TDD/CyberDojo
- This is about **P**erfect deliberate practice, thanks to doing in CloudCoder which should give accurate feedback 
        - They will have "learned how to learn" a programming language. 
- This is about being **P**aired on a 1:5 ratio with a real Java developer/trainer  with at least 5+ years of experience

####Action items for next JCC:

<p>1.	Part 1 can be Pre JCC to identify the average, below and above average students to pair them up in Part 2</p>

<p>2.	Mentors will be challenged with PC 1.51 Problems  before Pre JCC  (They must solve all the problems before JCC)</p>

<p>3.	Mentors should be come up with their own custom points for standard problems including FizzBuzzPlus, FileSorter etc (The introduction workshop will be organized for them)</p>

<p>4.	Mentoring with 1: 4 and they must be satisfy the following points :</p>
	a.	All the mentees should be through in PC-1 in CloudCoder
	b.	Report on their performance during the Camp should be submitted at end Of the camp
	c.	Continuous tracking of the students (Personally or Through Phone/Email is encouraged)
	d.	Making them understand the concept by Show/Tell Method
	e.	Weekly/Monthly report on Mentees progress if possible

<p>5.	Mentor can use their own teaching methodology to make them understand. The final goal must be to trigger interest in to learn Java</p>
<p>6.	Encourage them to do Projects (starting with Toy projects).  </p>
<p>7.	Mentors will be responsible for the students assigned to them.  At the end each team will have assessments.</p>
