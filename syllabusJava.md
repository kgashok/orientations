## 3 SEMESTER III CORE 5 : C++ PROGRAMMING

Subject Description: This subject deals with Object–oriented programming concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Goal: Knowledge on Object–oriented concept and programming with C++.

Objective: To inculcate knowledge on Object-oriented programming concepts using C++.

UNIT-I: Introduction to C++ - key concepts  of Object-Oriented Programming –Advantages

– Object Oriented Languages – I/O in C++ - C++ Declarations. Control Structures : - Decision Making and Statements : If .. else ,jump, goto, break, continue, Switch case statements - Loops in C++ : For,While, Do - Functions in C++ - Inline functions – Function Overloading.

UNIT-II : Classes and Objects : Declaring Objects – Defining Member Functions – Static Member variables and functions – array of objects –friend functions – Overloading member functions – Bit fields and classes – Constructor and destructor with static members.

UNIT-III

Operator Overloading: Overloading unary, binary operators – Overloading Friend functions – type conversion – Inheritance: Types of Inheritance – Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchal, Hybrid, Multi path inheritance – Virtual base Classes – Abstract Classes.

UNIT-IV:

Pointers – Declaration – Pointer to Class , Object – this pointer – Pointers to derived classes and Base classes – Arrays – Characteristics – array of classes – Memory models – new and delete operators – dynamic object – Binding , Polymorphism and Virtual Functions.
