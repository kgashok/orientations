# MCQ 
_Questions first, answers next, and then learning follows!_

1. In Java, everything is an **Object**. Just like in C++.
   - True or False?
4. In Java, there is a **main()** function that is primary (i.e._first_ function to be invoked) and independent of everything. Just like in C++. 
	- True or False? 
5. In Java, multiple inheritance is possible. Just like in C++. 
   - True or False? 
3. In Java, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is very similar in functionality to the C++ linker. The executable code loads and runs directly in the RAM. 
   - True or False?
4. In Java, everything is **pass by value**. Just like in the C language (note _not_ C++). 
	- True or False?
5. In Java, machine code is generated JIT from bytecode. It is therefore slower compared to C/C++. 
	- True or False? 
5. In Java, you never have to manually perform the memory deallocation of objects that are no longer needed. Therefore, there are no destructors for Java classes. Just like in C++. 
	6. True or False? 
6. In Java, there are no pointer data types or variables. So, **indirection** is not possible. Just like in C/C++. 
	7. True or False? 
6. The Java language components (JVM, JRE and SDK) are developed in Java itself. Just like C++ is built using the C++ language. 
	- True or False? 
7. In Java, `1/0 == 1.0/0.0`. Just like in C/C++. 
	8. True or False?
