# Ideas for Orientation

### Proposed Agenda 

####Intented Outcomes: 
 - Create a genuine interest to learn Java technology through exposure to Java developers / experts; gain confidence in learning Java programming skills; provide digital assets which will help in self-directed learning beyond the course
 - CONCEPTUAL - Course review; What's relevant and not so relevant? Deeper understanding of Why **Java Virtual Machine**? and Why **Collections** Framework? Inheritance and Interface (reinforced by CC PetSpeak exercises) 
 - EXPOSURE to Java Artifacts -  A **world-class** KGISL Java Enterprise Insurance Application used globally  - a Demo; KGISL development tools/environment; A Paint Java Application - to **inherit** and **extend**; A prize-winning Java Android Application demo by Praveen (KITE); REFCARDZ; 
 - PROGRAMMING -  First Program (visualized and single-stepped in PythonTutor); PC-1 Problem set for constructs; Right Numeric Triangle (RNT); how to become a good Java developer? Github and Open source and Gitter (WhatsApp for social coding); Java Lab on the Cloud; Excellent Online Tutorials  (http://j.mp/motherTutorial, http://j.mp/learningPathJava, http://j.mp/polyJava, http://j.mp/mapJava );
 -  Miscellaneous - MCQ; Mobile Hackshop @ KITE; KGISL CCS Java TDD Sessions

#### Schedule

### Suggested Artifacts
1. Subject Glossary + ConceptMap  - "the lay of the land" using Mindmup and/or ConceptMap for the 5 units; similar to this [polymorphism topic map]
	- Useful links to include in the glossary 
		- Demo and build Java programs/applets online - http://www.browxy.com/ or Cloud9? 
		- How to become a better Java developer? http://j.mp/betterJava
		- Stackoverflow Questions - http://j.mp/hashmapJava
		- Video to show - http://j.mp/jvmVideo (3 minutes, from C to Java) 
		- What is the purpose of an Applet - http://bit.ly/appletPurpose

2. Upfront **MCQ** - About 20-30 - aligned with intent to help them score well in assessments / final exams 
	- The 20 **WHY** Challenge Questions for Java 

3. Simplest Paint Application in Java - and run it through a Java Debugger
	- Show them how it all comes together!
    - Refactor one or more of the github repos (links provided below) that are already existing 
    - code printout for them to have on person 
    - Encourage them to read the "good book" and have clarifications
    - Single step through the program in Java Debugger (read-along session)
		- use PythonTutor for smaller problems (video keys) - using for the **firstJava** program
		- use GRASP to present graphical representation of the relationships
    - set up 3-4 line changes and how it impacts the functionality (_remix_ the story)

6. Learning resources 
We must track coding metrics - have every student at least complete 25-30 problems in Java, regardless of how poor they are. Coding mentors must be assigned on a 1:3 basis. 
	- Fundamental 7-Constructs practice 
		- PC1-Java 
		- Complete the http://j.mp/rntJavaTDD problem (a non-graphical Integrated Artifact, can become full fledged with a *suitable* interface class )
	- Pet Speak (the Java equivalent of the C++ program series - http://j.mp/PetKG
	- 200+ Java assignments - on CloudCoder
	- Practice-it problems (linked to a book "How to write Java programs") http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/

### Additional
6. Manual for the Java Labs with industry-standard keys for each of them 
	- Viva Q&A to be agreed upon for each of the lab exercises - here's an [example](https://rawgit.com/kgashok/orientations/master/javaLab/CarTruckProblem.png)
	- Run it like Continuous Assessment - amounting to 70% of the lab marks? 

5. Core Java **REFCARDZ** as vetted by [KGISL Java developers] - as a self-guided motivator to a Java IT career **@KGISL** - reviewed and ready to go 

7. CCS Session (pair programming with developers)
	- FizzBuzzMix OOP kata in CyberDojo for TDD skills (as recommended in http://j.mp/betterJava ) 
	- US High School AP problem [Mountain Paths](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/assignmentSheets/Nifty_MountainPaths_FullAssignment.pdf)

8. Android Mobile Workshop (@ KGISL Institute of Technology) happening in parallel
	- Contact: Prof Rajasekaran (gitter: **@rajasekaranap**) 
	- Those interested can sign up with him 
	- Want to earn some pizza money by doing [javadoc] work?
